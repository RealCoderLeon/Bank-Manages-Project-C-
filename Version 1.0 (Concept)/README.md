(SIGN IN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED!)
The Orignal project was not working with the sign In feature so this new version has been made again from scratch with a new core/base.
The library is still not made and the code is lacks polishing. This is just a slight glance at the full upcoming version (1.0). Thanks to "LeMaster Tech" on youtube for the code of the sign in feature.
